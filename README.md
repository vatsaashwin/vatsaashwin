## Hi, I'm [Aashwin](http://vatsaashwin.github.io/)! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" alt="wave" width="30px">

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about creating innovative systems to elevate people and make a positive impact on their overall lifestyle. As a part of the Software Innovation Track at my university, I work on building novel, intuitive applications that showcase improvement in a significant way on existing systems. 

- :books: I'm a Graduate Teaching Assistant for the course [Introduction to Usability Engineering](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1798837/assignments/syllabus) at Oregon State University.
- :seedling: Currently, I'm reading up on designing the architecture, components, and interfaces for scalable systems.
- :ski: When I'm on a break, I like to explore the beautiful Pacific Northwest, listen to interesting podcasts on technology or mindfulness, and pursue the latest hobbies I have picked up (have been enjoying skiing and swimming lately).
- â™¥ Community Development

I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration; best reached via email.
